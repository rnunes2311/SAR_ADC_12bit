# 12 bit SAR ADC
**Author:** Ricardo Nunes, www.linkedin.com/in/rnunes2311

This is a 12 bit SAR ADC designed using open source tools in the Skywater 130 nm PDK.
The ADC can be configured as differential (12 bit) or single-ended (11 bit). The comparator has offset self-calibration implemented, which can be enabled using an input pin.

¬π Input signal is sampled for 2 clock cycles. Clock/sampling frequency is limited by the 500 ‚Ñ¶ resistance from the pads to the circuit in the TinyTapeout IC.\
¬≤ Clock falling edge triggers the latched comparator, therefore clock low pulse width has to be larger than latched comparator propagation delay.\
¬≥ Typical values for INL/DNL based on C extraction. Mismatch is not included.\
‚Å¥ SNDR/ENOB do not include distortion introduced by TinyTapeout analog MUX.\
‚Åµ Noise estimated, not obtained directly from simulation.
